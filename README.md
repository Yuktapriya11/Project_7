This project combines two core data science techniques—dimensionality reduction and time series forecasting—under a single integrated analysis. The first part of the project focuses on reducing high-dimensional data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Using the Iris dataset, which contains four features representing different measurements of iris flowers, PCA was applied to reduce the dataset to two principal components. This reduction enables clear visualization of the data in 2D while preserving most of the variance. The result is a scatter plot that visually separates the three iris species, helping to better understand the structure of the dataset.

The second part of the project involves stock price prediction using time series analysis. A synthetic stock dataset (stock_prices.csv) was generated with daily records of Open, Close, and Volume values. The data was preprocessed by converting the date column, filling missing values, and setting the date as the time-series index. Exploratory analysis was conducted to observe price trends and engineer relevant features like lag values and rolling averages. An ARIMA model was then trained to forecast future stock prices, and its performance was evaluated using standard error metrics such as MAE and RMSE. The predicted stock prices were plotted against actual values to visualize model accuracy.

Together, these tasks demonstrate how dimensionality reduction and forecasting models can be used in tandem to extract insights and make informed predictions from complex datasets. The project provides a complete workflow—from preprocessing and visualization to modeling and evaluation—offering a hands-on example of real-world data analysis with Python.
